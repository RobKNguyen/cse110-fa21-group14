## Agenda:

###     Business for Today
        - Discuss what Makayla heard in Office Hours
          - prof recs spoonacular api
          - user stories are mainly so you can keep the user in mind
            - template: as a [_____], i want [______] (should help frame features from a user perspective)
              - should work from the user inwards rather than technology outwards; the technology should support the goals of my app rather than what i want to show i can do as a developer
          - we can just imagine that anything's possible at first and then delve into what's actually possible
          - both domain specific + human side is super important
          - Narrow Down Project to be more specific: "an extreme general app is difficult to write; narrow is easier but you need to think deeply!!"
            - We came up with the idea of maybe catering this web app to old people?? explore this more
              - Big text, very easy for old people to use
###     For Next Time
        - keep working on miro ideas.
## Decisions Made:
    - N/A
