## Agenda:
###     Unfinished Business
        - Reorganize Miro Board (Have Ashritha check the reorganized Miro Board)
###     Business for Today
        - We have a lot of tasks to do in order to complete the project pitch.
        - Last week, we didn't restrict ourselves with user personas, etc., but this week, we will take a subset (or just one) of the created personas to cater to.
        - Task 1: Filter out the users.
        - Task 2: Filter out the features.
            - Filter based on which caters best for the filtered set of users.
            - Need to see how many features we can handle with our amount of members while considering that we only have 6 weeks left.
            - Product should have common features but also domain-specific features.
                - common: CRUD features
            - Also how are we going to list recipes? (Preload? 3rd party API? Web Scraping?)
        - Should have a working prototype by the end of Week 8 or 9.
        - Task 3: Identify risks and rabbit holes.
            - Which features are risky?
            - What features are difficult to integrate? (In this case, if implementation is too difficult, we can just use 3rd party APIs, but we need to account for the risk that the API could malfunction or the integration of the API doesn't fit our website)
            - What makes some features risky?
            - Either quantify the risks or explain why a feature is risky.
        - Don't make the app too complex but also not too simple.
        - Task 4: Project Timeline
            - Basically the roadmap
            - Should have weeks' goals outlined (e.g. Must do y by Week x)
            - What should the progress be for weeks? (By Week x, how much of y should be done?)
            - Focuses on talking about high-level tasks.
            - What are the priorities of the project? What features are we implementing? What is the progress going to be?
        - Task 5: Designing
            - Start with low-fidelity designs by the end of this week
                - Either on paper or whiteboards (or software).
            - Should pay attention to how one screen will transition to another screen, etc.
            - Wireframes can be done with Figma but documented on Miro.
        - Task 6: The Pitch Itself
            - Highlight what we want to do: what are the users, features, risks, rabbit holes, etc.
            - Recommended to read the chapter on Writing the Pitch (starts on page 27)
                - Lists what the pitch should have.
                - No-gos: Features that are impossible to implement during this project.
            - Narrow down what you want to do and pitch it to a potential investor.
            - Wireframes are needed for the Pitch, not the Fat Marker Sketches.
            - Only after finalizing the pitch can we start coding, but we need to review this pitch with Ashritha first and get approval first.
                - Recommended to draft a pitch as soon as possible before the actual deadline (Nov. 1) and have her review it instead.
                    - Easier to review and fix, assuming there will be back and forth to fix issues.
                    - Either set up a meeting or send her the draft and let her review it asynchronously.
            - Also as an artefact, outline how users would interact with the website through flow charts, diagrams, etc.

###     For Next Time
        - Work on Tasks to complete the assignment due Monday.

## Decisions Made:
    - Ashritha approved the reorganized Miro Board (and Diane the Octopus).
    - Ended the meeting with Ashritha early due to lack of material left to go over as well as give the team time to work together with the new knowledge.
## Ending Time: 4:30pm
