###     Business for Today
        - Read through notes taken during the previous meeting
        - Reach the same page regarding the tasks we have to do
        - Some people have to go by 5pm or 5:30pm, so can only get so much done within the remaining time left together.
        - Completed Tasks 1 and 2 together.
            - Left with 4 User Personas remaining as well as 11 potential features.
        - Discussed other tasks, especially Task 3.

###     For Next Time
        - Hopefully work on a first draft for the Project Pitch.
        - Discuss more about what things still need to be done in order to reach specific goals.

## Decisions Made:
    - Have Ashritha approve a draft of the Project Pitch by Sunday so we can finalize and submit in time.
    - We all need to pick one of the filtered features (11 total) and explore its risks and rabbit holes (Task 3). Done on Miro.
    - Kyle will work on a draft of the project roadmap (Task 4).
    - Designers (Harsheta and Makayla) will start working on a low-fidelity design (Task 5).
